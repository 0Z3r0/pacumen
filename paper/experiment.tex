\section{Experiments and Results}
We collected the data using the {\tt --nflog} option in iptables, for outbound packets only. 
We extracted the features using the python wrapper to libcap --{\tt scapy} in linux and {\tt winpcapy} in windows.  

The pacumen tool can be run directly within a {\tt iPython} notebook and setting a variable to point to the directory with the pcap files. 
In order to run algorithms in Weka\cite{hall2009weka} we provide a converter. 
\section{Discussion}

%Metrics that we use to evaluate our techniques:

%$accuracy = \frac{Number\ of\ Correctly\ classified\ instances}{Total\ number\ of\ instances}$
We resort to standard measures of precision, recall and f-measure to
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

\[precision = \frac{Number\ of\ Correctly\ classified\ instances}{Total\ number\ of\  positive\ classifications}\]


\[recall = \frac{Number\ of\ Correctly\ classified\ instances}{Total\ number\ of\ class\ members}\]

\[f-measure = 2 . \frac{precision.recall}{precision + recall}\]
