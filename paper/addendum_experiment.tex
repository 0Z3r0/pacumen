%\subsection{Use of Standard Machine Learning Algorithms}
We ran our experiments on our machine learning algorithms and also on
standard machine learning algorithms in Weka. Table \ref{tbl-std}
shows the result.

The results are comparitively worse for the classes {\tt firefox.gmail} and {\tt firefox.linkedin}.  The extra rows {\tt gmail}
and {\tt linkedin} were created by combining the firefox and chrome versions of these classes.   It can be observed that
this union yielded better results, leading to the conclusion that the firefox and the chrome versions of the classes were often mistaken for one another. 

% The comparitively better results we see in the row for skype is either a reflection of
% the fact that skype being a standalone entity rather than a web-page based one,
% makes it easy to be distinguished, or we were just plain lucky -- by the time of
% the black hat event we will resolve this question by subjecting pacumen to 
% 10x the amount of data. We will wait till then to arrive at a detailed 
% comparison of our machine learning technique with standards ones from Weka.
